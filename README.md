# Service Management System [Project]
 This project aims to develop a computer program that implements an information system for a service management system. The program will store information about service orders, including order number, date, client name, device type (phone, tablet, laptop, monitor, TV, etc.), device serial number, client-reported problem (up to 50 characters), service technician name, repair details (up to 50 characters), price, duration of stay in the service center, and status (accepted order/rejected order/ reparation completed). The possible problems and repairs will be predefined in lists with a maximum of 20 entries each.
